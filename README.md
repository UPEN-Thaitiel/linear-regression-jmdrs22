# Linear Regression Assignment

## Objective

Apply linear regression to four real-world datasets. You will complete three provided notebooks and create a fourth one for the `house_prices.csv` dataset. All work must be submitted in this GitHub repository.

---

## Repository Contents

- `advertising.csv`  
- `movies.csv`  
- `Salary_dataset.csv`  
- `house_prices.csv`  
- `linear_regression_advertising.ipynb` ✅  
- `linear_regression_movies.ipynb` ✅  
- `linear_regression_salary.ipynb` ✅  
- `linear_regression_house_prices.ipynb` 🚧 *(to be created)*

## Instructions

### Step 1: Complete the Provided Notebooks
Complete the following three notebooks using the respective datasets:
- `advertising_regression.ipynb`
- `movies_regression.ipynb`
- `salary_regression.ipynb`

Follow the instructions in each notebook to complete the linear regression analysis.

### Step 2: Create a New Notebook
Create a new notebook named: `linear_regression_house_prices.ipynb`
Use the dataset: `house_prices.csv`  

Your notebook must include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Feature selection
- Linear regression model
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, R², etc.)
- Clear code and explanatory markdown cells

---

## Submission
